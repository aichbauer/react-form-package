# Introduction

> A declarative form component with inbuilt validation and state management

Install

```sh
$ npm i react-form-package -S
```

and import the components from `react-form-package` and you are ready to go.

```jsx
import {
  Form,
  Field,
  Button,
} from 'react-form-package';
```

`react-form-package` takes care about input validation, state management and user communication by using a declarative approach. `react-form-package` provides you with the logic and you are responsible for the styling. Write down how your form should look like in a similar struckture as plain HTML and `react-form-package` takes care of the rest.

But see for yourself:

<Playground>
  <Form
    validate
  >
    <div>
    Register
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Email
      </div>  
      <Field type="email" id="email" required />
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Password
      </div>  
      <Field type="password" id="password" min="8" required />
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Confirm Password
      </div>  
      <Field type="password" id="password2" min="8" required />
    </div>
    <div>
      <Button type="submit" id="submit" onClick={(state) => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(state, null, 2));
        alert('open the console to see the whole state...');
        console.log(state);
      }}>Register</Button>
    </div>
  </Form>
</Playground>
