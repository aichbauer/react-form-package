# State

> Working with the state data and meta data

A simple Example of how your Form could look like:

```jsx
<Form>
  <Field id="email" type="email" required />
  <Field id="password" type="password" required />
  <Button
    id="button"
    type="submit"
    onClick={(state) => this.handleOnClick(state)}
  >
    Submit
  </Button>
</Form>
```

> You can also use `onFocus`, `onChange`, and `onBlur` on every `Field`, `Select`, or `RadioGroup` components to get access to the state of the form ([more info](/react-form-package/on-focus-on-change-on-blur))

As you can see the `<Button />` component has a `onClick` property. This property takes a function. The `handleOnClick` function could look something like:

```js
async handleOnClick(state) {
  // do something with the state
  // e.g. send data to a server
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://server.com/login', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(state.data);
    });
    // do something with the response
  } catch(error) {
    // do something with the error
  }
}
```

As you can see the `state` parameter is an object. It has three different properties.

* **data**: `object`
* **meta**: `object`
* **formValid**: `boolean`

In our case `data` would hold:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "email": "",
    "password": ""
  }
}
```

`meta` would hold:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "email": {
      "initialValue": "",
      "dirty": false,
      "pristine": true,
      "visited": false,
      "touched": false,
      "value": "",
      "valid": false,
      "invalid": true,
      "rules": {
        "type": "email",
        "min": -1,
        "max": -1,
        "required": true,
      }
    },
    "password": {
      "initialValue": "",
      "dirty": false,
      "pristine": true,
      "visited": false,
      "touched": false,
      "value": "",
      "valid": false,
      "invalid": true,
      "rules": {
        "type": "password",
        "min": -1,
        "max": -1,
        "required": true,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`formValid` would hold:

```json
{
  "formValid": false
}
```
## Meta Description

Meta data gives you an overview of what happened on that field. E.g. if a field is `pristine` you could deside to not send its data to the server since, nothing changed.

PropertyÂ | Type | Description
---|---|---|
initialValue | `String` or `Bool` | 
dirty | `Bool` | `true` if the `value !== initialValue`
pristine | `Bool` | `true` if the `value === initialValue`
visited | `Bool` | `true` if this field was focused (`onFocus`)
touched | `Bool` | `true` if this field was blurred (`onBlur`)
value | `String` or `Bool` |
valid | `Bool` | `true` if this field is valid (passed all rules)
invalid | `Bool` | `true` if this field is invalid (failed at least one rules)
rules | `object` | the rules for the validation of this field
rules.type | `String` | `checkbox`, `date`, `textarea`, `datetime-local`, `email`, `number`, `tel`, `text`, `password`, `time`, `url`, `radio`, `select`
rules.min | `Number` | this field has to have at least `min` characters (`Int`)
rules.max | `Number` | this field has to have at maximum `max` characters (`Int`)
rules.required | `Bool` | this field is required (has to have a value)
