# File Upload

Sometimes you need to upload files with your form, e.g. if you want to upload a profile picture for a user.

Use a `<Field />` with the type `file` and you will get the `FileList` object back as value in the `data` object.

<Playground>
  <Form
    validate
    enctype="multipart/form-data"
  >
    <Field type="file" id="profilePicture" required />
    <Button
      id="submit"
      type="submit"
      onClick={(state) => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(state, null, 2));
        alert('open the console to see the whole state...');
        console.log(state);
      }}
    >
      Submit
    </Button>
  </Form>
</Playground>
