Also I did not find any library that came with an inbuilt validation system. Why do you need this? You should not consider writing your own validations if an email is always validated the same way, or the structure of a url is always the same. Writing your validations yourself can mislead you to produce duplicate code and this could lead to more bugs. What is also important: being flexible with styling. This is also not always easy with libararies. ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"react-form-package")," only brings the logic and you choose how to style it.
